# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 10.times do |i|
#   User.create( "email"=>"email_#{i+1}@ran.dom",
#   "password" => 12345678,
#   "created_at"=>Time.now,
#   "updated_at"=>Time.now)
# end
